Hello Guy!
I 'm Tech Priest
and i 've started learning react(about 1 month) and i 've just finnished my first project and i used figma for designing and inspiring.

i made some components for simple shopping web site and i would 've liked to share it here (just components AND the app file which includ layout.tsx and page.tsx).
i used next js frame word and tailwind
sorry about nameing in project :)))
anyone can use my project and change one or two components if needed
